- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessica-le
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any games / projects where you might need help with narrative design, illustration, concept, or graphic design
- 👀 I’m interested in game writing! I have a formal background in business & consulting, and have worked on a couple of independent graphic design / illustration projects.
